<H1>The Best Films According To Shaka</H1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<H3>Monsters Inc.</H3>
<p>An all time classic of animation, great for every situation</p>
<h3>Memento</h3>
<p>Not really a deep cut anymore but a powerful method of story telling from Christopher nolan<br />
Very unconventional using time and colour</p>
<h3>Die Hard With A vengence</h3>
<p>Ultimately, falls away with the ending (check out the deleted ending on Youtube) <br />
It's an excellent buddy movie with a lot of fun and serious action</p>
